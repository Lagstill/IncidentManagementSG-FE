Our frontend architecture revolves around creating a user-friendly and interactive interface using Streamlit. This interface acts as the gateway for users to interact with our application. It's designed to be intuitive and efficient for users to navigate and perform tasks.

To ensure that only authorized users can access the application, we have implemented a robust authentication and authorization system. This means that before users can utilize the application's features, they need to provide their credentials to prove their identity. Once authenticated, our system checks their authorization level to determine what specific functionalities they are allowed to use. This adds an extra layer of security and control over who can access sensitive information or perform critical actions.

The Streamlit frontend allows users to seamlessly interact with the application. They can input data, make selections, and trigger various actions using the provided widgets. After all, user-friendliness and a smooth experience are our top priorities.

As users engage with the interface, certain actions might require more complex processing or involve machine learning models. This is where our backend comes into play.
